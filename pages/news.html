          Today I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis, "Exploring the Climate Impacts of Solar Geoengineering on Land-Atmosphere Interactions." Up next is preparing for my move to Boulder, Colorado where I will start my NCAR postdoc at the end of September.

          I was excited to be a part of the inaugural <a href="https://www.grc.org/climate-engineering-conference/2017/" target="_blank">Gordon Research Conference on Climate Engineering</a>, held this summer at Sunday River in Newry, Maine. It was great to connect with old friends and practice presenting my research before my Ph.D. defense.

          I was pleased to accept an offer for a postdoctoral fellowship from the <a href="https://www.asp.ucar.edu/" target="_blank">Advanced Study Program</a> at the <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu/" target="_blank">National Center for Atmospheric Research</a>. Now I turn my attention to wrapping up my Ph.D!
