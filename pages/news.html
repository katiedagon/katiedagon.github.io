          I recently served as a scientific consultant and expert reviewer for the video series <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/reactions.html" target="_blank">Reactions</a>, produced by the American Chemical Society with PBS Digital Studios. The video I helped with covers the impact of methane on climate change, specifically focusing on methane emissions from agriculture. I had a lot of fun reviewing the material and the producers did a great job with the final cut. Check out the video here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnRFUSGz_ZM" target="_blank">Cow Burps Are Warming the Planet</a>.

          Next week I'll be attending the <a href="http://www.aps.org/meetings/march/about.cfm" target="_blank">American Physical Society March Meeting</a> in Los Angeles. As a member of the <a href="https://www.aps.org/units/gpc/" target="_blank">Topical Group on the Physics of Climate</a> and a new member of the GPC Program Committee, I'm especially excited for the GPC events on Tuesday March 6th. In the morning five invited speakers will participate in a session on "Energy Flows in The Climate System", while the afternoon consists of invited and contributed talks on "Multi-Scale Flows and Pathways in the Climate System." You can find more details in the latest <a href="https://www.aps.org/units/gpc/newsletters/upload/february18.pdf" target="_blank">GPC Newsletter</a>.

	      This week NCAR hosted the <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/events/wg-meetings/2018/land.html" target="_blank">Land Model Working Group Meeting</a> at the Mesa Lab. It was a busy 3 days of awesome land modeling talks, featuring everything from plant hydraulics to drought and fire risk. The latest version of the Community Land Model, <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/land/" target="_blank">CLM5</a>, was also released during the week. We finished off the week with a great tutorial on the new <a href="https://github.com/NGEET/fates-release" target="_blank">FATES model</a> (Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator), which is an open source dynamic vegetation model that can be used with CLM.

	      Today I took part in Colorado Science Day at the State Capitol in Denver. The event was organized by <a href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/faculty-staff/postdoctoral/ucdpostdoctoralassociation/outreach/projectbridge/Pages/projectbridge.aspx" target="_blank">Project Bridge Colorado</a>, an organization aimed at bridging the communication gap between scientists and the communities they work in. We presented our research to policymakers and staff during a special poster session featuring more than 50 early-career scientists from all across Colorado. It was a great experience talking to my state senator about my research and the work we do at NCAR. I also enjoyed meeting the organizers and other participants who were all equally excited about science communication and science policy! You can check out a collection of all the abstracts <a href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/faculty-staff/postdoctoral/ucdpostdoctoralassociation/outreach/projectbridge/capitol-day/Documents/CO%20Science%20Day%20Abstracts.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

	      I'll be attending the <a href="http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2017/" target="_blank">AGU Fall Meeting</a> in New Orleans next week. My talk is on Friday December 15th at 1:40pm, part of session B53J: Integrated Understanding of Climate, Carbon, Nutrient Cycles, Human Activities, and Their Interactions in Terrestrial Ecosystems. Come hear about how solar geoengineering impacts vegetation and lots of other fun topics!

	      Today I was honored to be a guest speaker at Mrs. Dana Wiegand's fourth grade class at Twin Peaks Charter Academy in Longmont. We talked about the difference between weather and climate, effects of climate change, and simple things kids can do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (like turning off the lights when no one is in the classroom). We even had time to do the lego supercomputer activity (see below) which was a big hit. I loved talking to the kids about climate science and hope to be able to do it again in the future!

	      Today I volunteered at <a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/super-science-saturday" target="_blank">Super Science Saturday</a>, a fun public science event held at the Mesa Lab where I work. I helped lead a lego activity for kids to learn about how supercomputers work. The legos were very popular and overall it was a great day of science!

          Today I start my postdoc at NCAR, where I will be working in the <a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/" target="_blank">Climate &amp; Global Dynamics Laboratory</a> with the <a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/tss/" target="_blank">Terrestrial Sciences Section</a>.

          I was honored to be a recent guest on Radio Boise's <a href="https://bgidaho.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Building a Greener Idaho</a>. I spoke with Kris Wilson about geoengineering in a segment entitled "Big Solutions for Big Problems."

          <b>July 28, 2017</b><br>
          Today I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis, "Exploring the Climate Impacts of Solar Geoengineering on Land-Atmosphere Interactions." Up next is preparing for my move to Boulder, Colorado where I will start my NCAR postdoc at the end of September.

          I was excited to be a part of the inaugural <a href="https://www.grc.org/climate-engineering-conference/2017/" target="_blank">Gordon Research Conference on Climate Engineering</a>, held this summer at Sunday River in Newry, Maine. It was great to connect with old friends and practice presenting my research before my Ph.D. defense.

          I was pleased to accept an offer for a postdoctoral fellowship from the <a href="https://www.asp.ucar.edu/" target="_blank">Advanced Study Program</a> at the <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu/" target="_blank">National Center for Atmospheric Research</a>. Now I turn my attention to wrapping up my Ph.D!
